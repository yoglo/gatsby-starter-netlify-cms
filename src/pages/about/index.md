### Club History

The Glasgow Handball Club was founded in the September of 2000 by Alasdair "Baba" Anderson and Kepa Mendibil and was one of the founder teams of the new Scottish Handball League. Glasgow HC started with only a men's team of 10 players. We have now grown to a Men's and Ladies section of over 30 players and will continue to grow. Glasgow players and coaches come from many European countries and have many years of experience and great passion for handball. Our mission is to grow handball in Glasgow and to sustain male and female handball teams in different age groups, taking part in the Scottish league and international tournaments.
