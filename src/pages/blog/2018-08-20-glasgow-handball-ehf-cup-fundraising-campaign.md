## \#14 for Glasgow Handball - Gabriel Fernandez Alonso

![Gabriel Fernandez Alonso](/img/gabri_profile.jpg)

Fernandez Alonso comes from the Spanish city of Leon, a city not new to handball. His first handball experience was with the historic club of [Ademar León](https://www.facebook.com/Ademar-Le%C3%B3n-161347353879568/) and later joined the team from the Universidad de Burgos in which season they had a good run at the national championship. Needless to highlight that Fernandez is a natural talent that retains a wide vision of the game, which comes natural only to him. Fernandez has been playing 5 seasons for Glasgow Handball. Unfortunately, throughout the pre-season preparations of last year Fernandez suffered a severe injury that kept him on the sidelines for most of the season. However, following operation and an intense rehabilitation program set and monitored by the club’s physiotherapist staff Kris Sports Therapy, Fernandez made an impressive recovery and comeback, and was instrumental in the final stages of the season to secure the League and Cup competitions, and eventually winning the British play-offs which paved the way to the #EHFCup qualifiers.

## \#12 for Glasgow Handball - Hamish Bottomley

![Hamish Bottomley](/img/hamish_profile.jpg)

The pride of [Kelvinside Academy](https://www.facebook.com/Kelvinside1878/) and foreseen as one of the most promising talents in [Scottish Handball Association](https://www.facebook.com/scottishhandballassociationofficial/) and[ British Handball Association](https://www.facebook.com/britishhandball/). Bottomley joined Glasgow Handball last season. His talent is second to none and his track record speaks for itself. Bottomley already won all the titles the national scene has to offer at a tender age of 17, what can be considered as a handball career goal and is probably the youngest British player to ever achieve this. The future is definitely bright, and with few national caps under his belt, Bottomley is looking forward to new challenges and eager to compete at 1 of the highest levels of #Europeanhanball.

## \#9 for Glasgow Handball - Andy Moose Wan Fung Lee

Previously playing for Ho Kwok Pui Chun, a 1st division team in Hong Kong, Wan Fung Lee joined Glasgow Handball 3 seasons ago and was another key to the success the team has been going throughout these past seasons. What he’s missing in height he makes up for it with his agility. His fighting spirit surely doesn’t pass unnoticed.

## \#17 for Glasgow Handball - Danos Sagias

![Danos Sagias](/img/danos_profile.jpg)

Dedication, commitment, and hard work are only a scratch on the tip of an iceberg when describing Sagias. A role model and an inspiration for the younger generation and definitely worth carrying the captain's strap. His passion for #handball was firstly discovered in Corfu with Feax Kerkyras. Throughout the 10 years spell playing for Glasgow Handball, Danos won several national titles with the club. His most recent success was last season where he captained the team through the most successful season in the club's history, winning the treble, consisting of the Scottish League, the Scottish Cup, and the British play-offs, and hence automatically qualifying for the EHF Cup for the first time.

## \#13 for Glasgow Handball - Alvaro Zarraga Lopez-Quiles

![Alvaro Zarraga Lopez-Quiles](/img/alvaro_profile.jpg)

Back with his Spanish club [S.D. El Pilar Valencia](https://www.facebook.com/sdelpilarvalencia/), Zarraga Lopez-Quiles was mainly utilised for an offense defence style of playing due to his physical nature, a combination of strength and height. Upon joining Glasgow Handball last season, through constant guidance and mentoring, the coaching staff worked closely with Zarraga and managed to fully exploit his abilities, increasing his potential as a player. The team worked on a style of play which fitted him best and which complemented the team’s style of game, turning him into a goal-making machine. This paid off and his contribution to meet the club’s objectives and consistency throughout the season were very valuable.

## \#77 for Glasgow Handball - Krzysztof Szulc

![null](/img/kris_profile.jpg)

Having previously played for [MTS Kwidzyn 2003](https://www.facebook.com/mtskwidzyn03/), [HG Hamburg Barmbek](https://www.facebook.com/HG.Hamburg.Barmbek/) and [Polski Cukier SPR Pomezania Malbork](https://www.facebook.com/PolskiCukierSprPomezaniaMalbork/), Szulc first joined Glasgow Handball back in 2008. Throughout his handball career in Scotland, Szulc tried out a short spell with Ayr Handball Club, after which he returned back to his natural home at Glasgow Handball last season. His commitment and professionalism on court and outside court is outstanding. Throughout the 2017/18 season, Szulc was also supporting the coaching staff sharing his knowledge and expertise on strength and conditioning preparations. Through him, the Glasgow players profited from [Kris Sports Therapy](https://www.facebook.com/krissportstherapy/) physiotherapist services.

## \#5 for Glasgow Handball - Francisco Cuéllar Bertos

![Francisco Cuéllar Bertos](/img/fran_profile.jpg)

The most experienced and time serving player for #Glasgowhandball, Cuéllar kicked off his career in Spain with PP. Escolapios Granada. From early days, Cuéllar showed great potential and had a very bright future ahead of him, but unfortunately was struck by an accident which pushed him away from the game. After several years absence the Glasgow climate re-ignited the passion for handball, and after 10 years playing for the club, Fran will now be exploring new territories, competing at 1 of the highest level competition in European handball.

## \#1 for Glasgow Handball - Josef Camilleri

![Josef Camilleri](/img/jo_profile.png)

A product of [Lasalle handball club](https://www.facebook.com/LaSalleHc/), after building a colourful portfolio winning Leagues, Cups and Knock-out titles from juniors through to seniors level at Malta handball association, Camilleri joined Glasgow handball 6 seasons ago and lead the team to several national Scottish handball titles. The EHF Cup will be the last games which Camilleri will be playing for the Scottish side, after which he will be venturing on French grounds. Hence he will definitely want to make this one count.
