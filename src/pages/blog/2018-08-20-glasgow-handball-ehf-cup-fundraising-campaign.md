## \#13 for Glasgow Handball - Alvaro Zarraga Lopez-Quiles

Back with his Spanish club [S.D. El Pilar Valencia](https://www.facebook.com/sdelpilarvalencia/), Zarraga Lopez-Quiles was mainly utilised for an offense defence style of playing due to his physical nature, a combination of strength and height. Upon joining Glasgow Handball last season, through constant guidance and mentoring, the coaching staff worked closely with Zarraga and managed to fully exploit his abilities, increasing his potential as a player. The team worked on a style of play which fitted him best and which complemented the team’s style of game, turning him into a goal-making machine. This paid off and his contribution to meet the club’s objectives and consistency throughout the season were very valuable.



## \#77 for Glasgow Handball - Krzysztof Szulc

Having previously played for [MTS Kwidzyn 2003](https://www.facebook.com/mtskwidzyn03/), [HG Hamburg Barmbek](https://www.facebook.com/HG.Hamburg.Barmbek/) and [Polski Cukier SPR Pomezania Malbork](https://www.facebook.com/PolskiCukierSprPomezaniaMalbork/), Szulc first joined Glasgow Handball back in 2008. Throughout his handball career in Scotland, Szulc tried out a short spell with Ayr Handball Club, after which he returned back to his natural home at Glasgow Handball last season. His commitment and professionalism on court and outside court is outstanding. Throughout the 2017/18 season, Szulc was also supporting the coaching staff sharing his knowledge and expertise on strength and conditioning preparations. Through him, the Glasgow players profited from [Kris Sports Therapy](https://www.facebook.com/krissportstherapy/) physiotherapist services.

## \#5 for Glasgow Handball - Francisco Cuéllar Bertos

The most experienced and time serving player for #Glasgowhandball, Cuéllar kicked off his career in Spain with PP. Escolapios Granada. From early days, Cuéllar showed great potential and had a very bright future ahead of him, but unfortunately was struck by an accident which pushed him away from the game. After several years absence the Glasgow climate re-ignited the passion for handball, and after 10 years playing for the club, Fran will now be exploring new territories, competing at 1 of the highest level competition in European handball.

## \#1 for Glasgow Handball - Josef Camilleri

A product of [Lasalle handball club](https://www.facebook.com/LaSalleHc/), after building a colourful portfolio winning Leagues, Cups and Knock-out titles from juniors through to seniors level at Malta handball association, Camilleri joined Glasgow handball 6 seasons ago and lead the team to several national Scottish handball titles. The EHF Cup will be the last games which Camilleri will be playing for the Scottish side, after which he will be venturing on French grounds. Hence he will definitely want to make this one count.
