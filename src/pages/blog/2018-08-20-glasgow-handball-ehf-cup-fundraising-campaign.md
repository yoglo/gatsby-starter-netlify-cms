The most experienced and time serving player for #Glasgowhandball, Cuéllar kicked off his career in Spain with PP. Escolapios Granada. From early days, Cuéllar showed great potential and had a very bright future ahead of him, but unfortunately was struck by an accident which pushed him away from the game. After several years absence the Glasgow climate re-ignited the passion for handball, and after 10 years playing for the club, Fran will now be exploring new territories, competing at 1 of the highest level competition in European handball.

## \#1 for Glasgow Handball - Josef Camilleri

A product of Lasalle handball club, after building a colourful portfolio winning Leagues, Cups and Knock-out titles from juniors through to seniors level at Malta handball association, Camilleri joined Glasgow handball 6 seasons ago and lead the team to several national Scottish handball titles. The EHF Cup will be the last games which Camilleri will be playing for the Scottish side, after which he will be venturing on French grounds. Hence he will definitely want to make this one count.
