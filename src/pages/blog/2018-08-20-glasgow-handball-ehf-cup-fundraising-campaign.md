## \#1 for Glasgow Handball - Josef Camilleri

A product of Lasalle handball club, after building a colourful portfolio winning Leagues, Cups and Knock-out titles from juniors through to seniors level at Malta handball association, Camilleri joined Glasgow handball 6 seasons ago and lead the team to several national Scottish handball titles. The EHF Cup will be the last games which Camilleri will be playing for the Scottish side, after which he will be venturing on French grounds. Hence he will definitely want to make this one count.
