Glasgow handball men's team finished the season in style!

Here is an extract from the British handball news, full article available [here](https://www.britishhandball.com/news/glasgow-win-2018-british-championship-play). 

Scottish champions Glasgow came from behind to defeat Livingston 31-26 in this weekend’s final of the British Handball Championship play-offs.



The result sees Glasgow complete the treble of Scottish league and cup, and British Championship titles.



Livingston and Glasgow kept pace with each other in the early exchanges with the score 9-8 after 20 minutes. However, a 3-1 exchange saw Livingston pull away to lead 15-12 at half time. Livingston kept-up the pace after the break increasing their lead to 21-17. Glasgow came surging back as Livingston’s attack faltered and with 10minutes to go the scores were level at 22-22. Glasgow now had the initiative and although Livingston fought bravely to the end, Glasgow finished stronger and won 31-26 to become 2018 British Champions. Livingston’s Ross Strachan was the final’s top scorer with 12 goals, while Gabriel Fernandez top scorer for Glasgow as he beat the keeper nine times.



The event brought together Glasgow, and second-place Scottish side Livingston, along with English champions London GD and runners-up Olympia.



On Saturday, in the first semi-final, Glasgow set the pace from the beginning, as Olympia’s finishing in front of goal let them down. However, at half-time the London club still only trailed 12-15. In a heated second half, Glasgow pulled away, helped by numerous suspensions for Olympia and established control on the game, going on to win 30-22. Michael Thomas top-scored for Glasgow with seven goals, while Carlos Navarro replied with five strikes for Olympia.
