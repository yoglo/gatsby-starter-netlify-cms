As the Czech Republic trip came to an end for the Glasgow HC team, so did the European EHF Cup journey.



Nonetheless, one can say that new opportunities were explored, valuable lessons were learned, top handball level was witnessed, and the small taste of this experience will be the motivation potion for the team to strive to succeed in the new coming season.



The following match reports recounts the encounters of the Glasgow HC against ‘Goliath’ Talent Plzen in the European cup qualifiers.



## First Leg – 02/09/18



On the first day of the EHF Cup Round 1, newcomers Glasgow HC met Talent Plzen. It was a tough day at the office for Glasgow HC as the experienced Czech side took matters in their hands as from the early stages. While a nervous Glasgow team struggled to settle down in the beginning of the game, Plzen took advantage of Glasgow’s mistakes in attack and punished the Scottish team with fast breaks, with the Czechs making the most out of the one-against-one situations with the goalkeeper. The score after 13 minutes was 13 - 1 for Plzen and the Glasgow hopes for a competitive game were shattered from the very beginning. Following a time-out, a more calmed-down Glasgow set a flowing and steady pace in the second part of the first half and managed to score 4 goals while conceding 9, resulting in a half time score of 22 - 5 for Plzen.



After a bad start in the second half, conceding 4 unanswered goals in 4 minutes, the Glaswegians tried to fight their way back scoring a few more goals, however they were still finding it hard to penetrate the Czech’s aggressive 5-1 defence. The Glasgow team, led by coach Ian Psaila, opted to change to a 3-2-1 style defence, and this proved effective with a number of good defensive efforts stopping Plzen’s set attacks. However Plzen weren’t about to throw away their leading margin. The Czechs kept the same standards throughout the match causing damage to the Scottish team. Plzen managed to keep their supporters excited winning with a 27 goal difference, which didn’t reflect good on Glasgow’s performance.



**Final score: Talent Plzen 39 – 12 Glasgow HC (22 – 5).**



**Glasgow HC Team**: _Danos Sagias 3 (1/1 pen), Inigo Arraras 2 (2/4 pen), Jakub Piatek 2, Michael Thomas 2, Alvaro Zarraga 1, Andy Lee 1, Sebastian Blaszczyk, Hamish Bottomley, Josef Camilleri, Fran Cuellar, Gabri Fernandez, Yoann Gloaguen, Dominik Michnak, Kris Szulc, Benji Vote. _  



In his post-match comments, captain Sagias confessed “_We were frustrated and disappointed with our performance in the beginning of the first game as we let the situation take the better of us. A combination of factors, amongst which the lack of preparation games in the summer period and the lack of experience at such level, just to mention few, resulted in a disastrous start of the game_.” “_This game leaves a bitter taste in our mouth as we know that a 27 goal deficit doesn’t reflect the quality of Glasgow HC_” the captain added.



## Second Leg – 03/09/18



On the second leg of the EHF Cup Round 1, Glasgow started very strong with a solid performance in defence. Similarly, the attacks were paced and carefully executed. As the game progressed, Glasgow’s confidence grew and so did the scoring rhythm. The Glasgow goalkeepers distinguished themselves affecting some outstanding saves. After 17minutes of play time, Glasgow were finding their way through the Czech defence netting a total of 6 goals and conceding 8 goals. At this point the Plzen manager was forced to call the first time-out of the game.



The Scottish team kept fighting for every possession, hard contact ensuring the opponent felt them in defence, and going through every gap in attack. The score after 24 minutes was 8 - 11 for Plzen. At this point the Czech team struggled to open the gap wider and it felt like Glasgow had earned the respect of their opponent. However at this level, one cannot lose the concentration, and as that happened, consequences followed. Talent Plzen punished Glasgow by scoring 5 goals in 6 minutes. At half time whistle, Plzen entered their dressing room with an 8 goal lead.



The second half says a slightly different story. Though the constant physical effort put in defence did pay off, as Talent Plzen only managed to score 14 goals, Glasgow were seen struggling in attack. As a result, the goal difference increased, and in the 44th minute the score was 9 - 25 for Plzen. Following a time out, the Glaswegians managed to run their own 3 - 1 lead to get the score line to 12 – 26, 9 minute from the final whistle. After 57 minutes, Plzen were kept to 27 goals, but despite the good team effort made by the Glasgow team, they conceded 3 goals in the last 3 minutes of the game.

**Final score: Glasgow HC 12 – 30 Talent Plzen (8 – 16).**

**Glasgow HC Team**: _Danos Sagias 4 (1/2 pen), Yoann Gloaguen 4, Gabri Fernandez 2, Fran Cuellar 1, Michael Thomas 1, Inigo Arraras (0/1 pen), Sebastian Blaszczyk, Hamish Bottomley, Josef Camilleri, Andy Lee, Dominik Michnak, Jakub Piatek, Kris Szulc, Benji Vote, Alvaro Zarraga_.



In the post-match comments, captain Sagias said “_We knew that the main two barriers were going to be fatigue and inexperience at this top level. Each time we dropped the guard, the opponent was ready to punish us. Unlike yesterday, today I can say that I’m proud of the team’s performance. There is always room for improvement, but today we showed the team spirit which truly reflects our real character. We can now all leave Plzen with a smile on our face._”



The Plzen coach expressed disappointment of his team’s performance in the second leg. With reference to the comments released in an interview in the Czech media where he remarked that the Glasgow HC players do this as a hobby, in Glasgow this is portrayed as the passion for the sport. It’s true that Glasgow HC doesn’t have a professional setup and that the resources are much more limited than that of a professionally established team that trains twice a day. Prior to this trip, there were never any delusions, and everyone in Glasgow knew from the beginning that at this level, at this stage, there is no match between the two sides. However with the right mind-set, when the Glasgow team decided to put the fears aside, played with the heart and did what they had planned to do, one could sense the opponent’s frustration in not managing to open the scoring gap wider. This is more than just practising a hobby. The outcome of the first game does not say the true story. It is true that probably this was weakest opponent that Plzen will face in their journey this season, but a lesson is due to be learned from those standing on the other side of the court, no opponent should be taken for granted.



Glasgow HC would like to thank the host team, Talent Plzen, for the hospitality and for all the organisational support. We would also like to thank the over 750 Plzen fans attending the games for creating such a warm atmosphere.



A massive thanks goes to our valuable sponsors, Kris Sports Therapy, Energo eco-tech, Beauty Beehive & edynamic Computing Cloud, as without them the club wouldn’t have the resources to compete at top level, both locally and internationally.



Thanks to everyone who constantly follows the team and supported the crowdfunding campaign. All your support and encouragement was a motivation in itself to keep the team going.



Special thanks goes to SHA, BHA, Tryst 77 HC & Livingston HC for helping the team in the preparation for the European competition.



Final Thanks goes to coach Ian Psaila and team officials, Marta Maldonado and Geraldine Camus for constantly assisting the team throughout this competition, and to Thomas Arnaud who made his way to Plzen to support the team against all odds.
